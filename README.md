# Novel_Nutritional_Recipe_Recommendation
We Utilize a simple Regression  along with a graph embedding to work on a Recipe recommendation system that can  suggest the users with recipes depending upon their previous choices.

The generated files from the above codes can be found at glink: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dik2MGn1CuyhvlesoMAZNavr5cPxFrzg?usp=sharing
"In the glink link run try_user_rec.ipynb to recommend the recipies to the target user within the database"
"In the glink run Replace_Novality.ipynb to recommend the novel version of the recipes by replacing the first ingredient with its most similar ingredient"

ðŸ‘‰ If you want to generate all the files then run the system, Run All Files in an order given to each file starting from 1Preprocessing_data to 13Evaluation_system.
